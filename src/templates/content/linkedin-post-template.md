## Example Post

I failed 7 interviews before getting my dream job.

Here's what finally changed everything:

1. I stopped memorizing answers
Instead, I prepared 5 stories that showed my skills in action.

2. I asked better questions
"What does success look like in the first 90 days?" showed I was already thinking like an employee.

3. I followed up differently
No "thanks for your time." I sent a 1-page doc solving a problem they mentioned.

Result: 3 offers in 2 weeks.

The job market is competitive, but so are you.

What interview strategy has worked best for you?
