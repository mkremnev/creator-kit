## Example Post

**Why I stopped checking email before 10am**

For years, I started every morning in my inbox.

Result: I was reactive all day, putting out fires instead of doing meaningful work.

**The change:**
• First 2 hours = focused work only
• Phone on DND until 10am
• Email processed in two batches (10am, 4pm)

**What happened:**
→ Deep work hours increased by 3x
→ Response quality improved (less rushed)
→ Stress levels dropped significantly

The inbox will always be full. Your energy won't.
