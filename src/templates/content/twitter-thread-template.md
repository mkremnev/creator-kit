**Tweet 2:**
Template 1: The Specific Compliment

"I loved your [specific thing]. Especially [detail that shows you actually consumed it]."

Then make your ask.

Specificity = credibility.

**Tweet 3:**
Template 2: The Mutual Connection

"[Name] suggested I reach out..."

Even a weak connection beats cold.

If you don't have one, find one on LinkedIn.

**Tweet 4:**
Template 3: The Quick Question

"Quick question about [topic they know]:"

Ask something they can answer in 1-2 sentences.

Easy = more likely to reply.

**Tweet 5:**
Template 4: The Value-First

Send something useful before asking for anything.

"I noticed [problem]. Here's a quick fix:"

Give before you get.

**Tweet 6:**
Template 5: The Social Proof

"I've helped [similar company/person] achieve [result]."

Show you've done it before.

Results speak louder than promises.

**Tweet 7:**
Template 6: The Specific Ask

Don't say "pick your brain."

Say exactly what you want:
→ 15-min call
→ One piece of advice
→ Quick intro

Vague asks get ignored.

**Tweet 8:**
Template 7: The Follow-Up

Most replies come from follow-up #2 or #3.

Wait 3-5 days.
Add new value.
Keep it short.

Persistence (not pestering) wins.

**Tweet 9:**
To recap:

1. Specific compliment
2. Mutual connection
3. Quick question
4. Value-first
5. Social proof
6. Specific ask
7. Follow-up

The secret? All 7 focus on THEM, not you.

If this was helpful, retweet tweet 1.

Follow @[handle] for more.
